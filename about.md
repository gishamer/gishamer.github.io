My name is Flurin Gishamer and I am currently working as a machine learning engineer.

This is my personal blog where I write about topics I'm interested in, which are mostly related to NLP, speech technology, ML-Ops, and machine learning in general.

You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fluringishamer/)
